# Audit-logging

Audit logging is the process of documenting activity within the software systems used across your organization. Audit logs record the occurrence of an event, the time at which it occurred, the responsible user or service, and the impacted entity. All of the devices in your network, your cloud services, and your applications emit logs that may be used for auditing purposes.
